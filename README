TEST FORMAT
- multiple chares (single chare per node with -ntasks-per-node=1)
- each chare reads from separate section of file with single fread call
- time the individual freads and time from fopen through fread, collecting max and average results with a reduction

IMPORTANT: script error handling is not done! follow the instructions or weird things will happen!

TO SUBMIT TESTS:
1) cd ckio-analysis
2) make
3) ./slurm-tools/submit-all.sh <filepath> <test-config> <filesize>
   - filepath should be the full path to the input file
   - test-config will be the name of the output dir in ./output (eg. "8GBnosmp")
   - filesize should correspond to the input file size in GB
   - then wait for jobs to finish...
4) python3 ./slurm-tools/format-results.py <test-config>
   - this script formats the output into a table and prints it
   - mostly for easy copy paste to excel
